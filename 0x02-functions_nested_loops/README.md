# FUNCTIONS AND NESTED LOOPS

A function is a block of organised codes that is used to perform a task. it makes things easy. functions are defined in this format:
`int variable_variable_type{your code goes in here})` 
for example 
`
int sum(int a, int b)   
{ 	int result; 
	result = a + b; 
	return result; 
}
` 
After defining the function, the function is called. 
`
$ sum(5, 4); 
$ 9 
`
Nested loop is simply a loop inside a loop.
