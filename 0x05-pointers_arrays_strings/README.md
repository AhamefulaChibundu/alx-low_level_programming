# POINTERS AND ARRAYS

Pointers are variable names which store addresses of variables. it could be of any data type. To declear a pointer we use `data_type *variable_name;` eg `int *p;`. so many operations can be carried out using a pointer.

An array is used to store data of same type, they can be decleared in this format `data_type variable_mane[number of space needed] = {elements or data goes in here}` Eg `int array[6] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`
